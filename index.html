                <figcaption>Garlic Lobster Pasta</figcaption>
                <p>This lobster pasta is essentially an aglio e olio with a secret ingredient. It’s loaded with pieces of lobster and finished with crunchy bread crumbs. The lobster is tossed in at the last minute, just to heat it through and get all those garlicky umami flavors on it without overwhelming the sweet flavor of the lobster meat. It comes together super quickly, like most pasta dishes. Grab some cooked lobster tails, and you have a quick, easy, impressive date night dish.</p>

                <figcaption>Bolognese</figcaption>
                <p>Essentially, Bolognese is a ragu (meat based sauce served over pasta) made famous in Bologna and now popular worldwide. Typically, Bolognese includes: meat (a mix of beef and pork), a classic soffritto (onion, celery, carrot), wine, milk or cream, and tomatoes. Bolognese in Bologna is almost always served with tagliatelle.</p>

                <figcaption>Pasta alla Norcina Recipe</figcaption>
                <p>Like Bolognese, some people would say that this pasta only works in the specific city in Italy it’s named for: Norcia, where the pigs are so good they fly around upon clouds of rainbows and sunshines. And it’s true: both the province of Umbria and the city of Norcia are famous throughout Italy for almost every ingredient in this dish.</p>

                <p>I know what you’re thinking: meatballs on a weekday?! Yes, it’s true, after a long day of work the last thing I want to do is roll meatballs. In fact, getting delivery is probably my most favorite way to have a relaxing night. But, sometimes only homemade will do. In those cases, homemade plus Instant Pot is the answer.</p>

                <p>Of course, meat lovers pizza – or any pizza for that matter – isn’t pizza without cheese. You’ve got to have an ooey gooey base for all your toppings to meld into. As such, this pizza is loaded with about equal parts Canadian cheese and meats. It’s truly a feast for the meat – and cheese – lover in your life. Hope you’re staying warm and cheesing it up!</p>

                <figcaption>Pizza Toast Recipe</figcaption>
                <p>Give me ALL the pizza toasts! Was there any after-school snack that was better than pizza toast? Wait, don’t answer that because asking me to choose between after-school snacks is just too cruel – they’re all so good. But, pizza toast holds a special spot in my heart because it was one of my small repertoire of recipes that I could make on my own, at seven years old. Other recipes included: regular toast, butter and sugar toast, instant noodles, and scrambled eggs.</p>

                <p>It’s so funny how foods you grow up with (shell-on-shrimp, rice for breakfast, dried pork fluff sandwiches) seem the norm as a child. Then the moment comes when you go to school, bring out your lunch of congee, salt and peppery shrimp and pork floss buns and realize just how untransferable certain food items may be.</p>

                <p>This fennel sausage pizza is one of the “really, really good” pizzas. It’s what happens when it’s three in the morning, your husband’s hungry and you have a bunch of leftover pizza materials in the fridge. Nothing goes together better than late nights and pizza!</p>
